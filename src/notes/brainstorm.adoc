= Write in AsciiDoc, Publish Everywhere: Brainstorm

== Big Idea / Purpose

To present/articulate why AsciiDoc and the Asciidoctor toolchain is a sound investment for your content effort.

* toolchain
* format
* growth
* philosophy
* strategy
* comprehension of technical problem
* applicability

== Ideas

content lives many lives, has many masters

what are the capabilities? what are your needs?

I believe there are three capabilities to consider when evaluating the value proposition of a content platform.

. creation
. publication
. collaboration

creation::
* this section is about AsciiDoc the syntax; it speaks to the writers
* why AsciiDoc accomodates creation:
  - familiar conventions and terminology
  - clear & concise ("I can see clearly now, the tags are gone. I can see all obstacles in my way.")
  - consistent, repeatable patterns
  - line-oriented, left-aligned (leverage the medium)
  - semantic (promotes separation, informs transformation)
* dialects via conventions or extensions
* partition -> composable, referencable
* partial (tag) includes
* DRY / single source of truth
* xrefs
* conversion to AsciiDoc is relatively easy; many groups have done it

publication::
* this section is about Asciidoctor, the processor; it speaks to the engineers
* what can/do you do with the content now that you have it?
* separation of content and presentation
* you are free to interpret the content anyway you like
* there's a default interpretation of the content by the built-in converters
* examples of extension / interpretation:
  - tabs, background image for slide, import PDF page, slide notes
* database of information (digest, catalog, library, source of record), not textual representation of output
* cite ways to extend, customize, integrate
* cite examples of "everywhere" (i.e., channels)
* _transformation_ is the key to being able to publish to multiple channels
* AsciiDoc as a target format
  - either leverage the toolchain or for hybrid content (part generated, part scribed)
* toolchain can be an orchestrator for weaving together content sources
* endless possibilities for your content
* future proof, no-lockin; transformation capability can be leverages to migrate to another format
* queryable / mine for information in a contextual way
* can be used to populate a search index or content/site map
* publication can tap into the history via VCS

collaboration::
* this section is speaks to both the writers and the engineers as a collective
* VCS-friendly (no binary blobs)
* quote about increase in contributions; force of contribution
> The OpenShift team, who had undertaken a similar effort, reported that after the migration from DocBook to AsciiDoc, the rate of both internal and external contributions skyrocketed—from several a year to several a week.
> Even without much announcement, mere days after the migration, we started seeing incoming Merge Requests in GitLab, where there were none before.
> It may be too soon to judge, but preliminary results hint that this indeed is an observable trend.
* Nothing drives that more, invites participation more, than the "Edit on GitHub" link
<Screenshot of Edit on GitHub link>
* works well with code review tools
* docs = code
* issue tracker
* work using your own tools, own writing environment
* no need for special, proprietary, costly tools
* work in different part of files w/o conflict
* well-factored, modular
* consider using the topic-based authoring method
* "happy people collaborate well" (or are more inclined to)
* easier to moniter the workflow (i.e., "what changed?")
* practices that enhance collaboration, like sentence-per-line

== Responses to Questions Posed by Abstract

=== How to organize your documentation

* group content by version line; each discrete content container should have its own git repository
  - contrast to "library layout", where there is one directory for each book
* use branches to maintain different versions to leverage capabilities of VCS
  - AsciiBinder is an example of a tool that encourages this model
* try to avoid coupling source file with output path
* give the document a "business ID" so you can track it migrates
* make sure you start with a good foundation; much harder to fix cross-cutting problems after writing has started
* ...

=== How to make your documentation approachable to contributors

* GitHub
* code review tools
* document templates
* writing style guide; for syntax, for structure, for patterns, for voice (automate the human)
  - The style guide ensures that after the conversion, all writers know what conventions they should adhere to. 
  - This can drastically curtail expensive micro-migrations
* don't impose tool/editor choices
* consistent, discoverable structure
* "happy people collaborate well" (or are more inclined to)
* ...

=== How to make your documentation easy to maintain

* DRY (use includes for shared and imported content)
  - AsciiDoc can even share content across multiple repositories
  - consider using the topic-based authoring method
  - generate reference material
* modular
* standardized layout
* automated builds
* validation
* continuous integration / deployment; "(git) push to publish"
* don't mix migration changes with content changes
* if you do migrate, do it quickly and don't go half way
* ...

=== What tools to use to simplify collaboration & maximize reuse

* VCS like git
* have an issue tracker for your content
* organize issues into milestones that represent capabilities
* DocBookRx to convert from DocBook to AsciiDoc; a PSA about pandoc
* ...

== Slide Concepts

* Capabilities as striped list (maybe with some icons)
* Writer's Write
* Stunned (or irritated ) owl reacting to DocBook
* Skeptical squirrel reacting to LaTeX
* Bird nest for LaTeX
* Left alignment editor icon to represent line-oriented + left-aligned

== Image Concepts

* content-many-directions - one sign pointing to marketing, another to developers
